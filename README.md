Dscription of the project:
This project captures the MRI data related to the concept of incentive delay. With the tool NeuroSynth a meta-analysis (N=79) of the functionally related brain regions could be performed and visualized. The visualizations include one brain image with the functional areas color-tagged as well as a histogram that captures the frequency voxels where found and the corresponding z-scores of the the degree to which each voxel is consistently activated in the used studies about Inecentive Delay.

Table of contents:
- Data:
  I used data from the NeuroSynth: an open source platform Neurosynth for automatically synthesizing the results of many different neuroimaging studies. 
- Jupyter Notebook:
  I used VS code to run my Conda environment and worked inside a Jupyter Notebook called [(HomeAssignment.ipynb)](https://github.com/MarjetVU/Incentive-Delay-Mapped-in-the-Brain/blob/main/HomeAssignment.ipynb).
- Pull request:
  I did a [Pull Request](https://github.com/MarjetVU/Incentive-Delay-Mapped-in-the-Brain/blob/main/Pull%20request%20Merel%20van%20Steenis.tiff) via GitHub for Merel van Steenis' page.
