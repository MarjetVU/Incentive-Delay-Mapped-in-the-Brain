Dscription of the project:
This project captures the MRI data related to the concept of incentive delay. With the tool NeuroSynth a meta-analysis (N=79) of the functionally related brain regions could be performed and visualized. The visualizations include one brain image with the functional areas color-tagged as well as a histogram that captures the frequency voxels where found and the corresponding z-scores of the the degree to which each voxel is consistently activated in the used studies about Inecentive Delay.
